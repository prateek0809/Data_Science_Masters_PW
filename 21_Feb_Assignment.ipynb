    "1. Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):- EC2 is a cloud platform provided by Amazon that offers secure, and resizable compute capacity. Its purpose is to enable easy access and usability to developers for web-scale cloud computing, while allowing for total control of your compute resources. Deploy applications rapidly without the need for investing in hardware upfront; all the while able to launch virtual servers as-needed and at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Amazon RDS (Relational Database Services):- Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes database configuration, management, and scaling easy in the cloud. Automate tedious tasks such as hardware provisioning, database arrangement, patching, and backups – cost-effectively and proportionate to your needs. RDS is available on various database instances which are optimized for performance and memory, providing six familiar database engines including Amazon Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle. database, and SQL server. By leveraging the AWS Database Migration Service, you can easily migrate or reproduce your existing databases to Amazon RDS. Visit Amazon’s RDS page.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):- Amazon S3, at its core, facilitates object storage, providing leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Businesses of vast sizes can leverage S3 for storage and protect large sums of data for various use cases, such as websites, applications, backup, and more. Amazon S3’s intuitive management features enable the frictionless organization of data and configurable access controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Amazon Lambda:- Lambda permits you to run code without owning or managing servers. Users only pay for the compute time consumed. Operate code for nearly any application or backend utility without administration. Users just upload the code, and Lambda does the rest, which provides precise software scaling and extensive availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Amazon Cognito:- AWS Cognito administers a control access dashboard for on-boarding users through sign-up, and sign-in features to their web and mobile apps.
