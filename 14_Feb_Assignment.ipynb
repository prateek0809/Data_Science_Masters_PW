    "Ans- Deadlock:- When two processes are waiting for each other directly or indirectly, it is called deadlock. This usually occurs when two processes are waiting for shared resources acquired by others. For example, If thread T1 acquired resource R1 and it also needs resource R2 for it to accomplish its task.\n",

    "Race Conditions:- A race condition is an undesirable situation that occurs when a device or system attempts to perform two or more operations at the same time, but because of the nature of the device or system, the operations must be done in the proper sequence to be done correctly. Race conditions are most commonly associated with computer science and programming. They occur when two computer program processes, or threads, attempt to access the same resource at the same time and cause problems in the system. Race conditions are considered a common issue for multithreaded applications."
